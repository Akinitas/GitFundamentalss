#git init

The `git init` command is used to create an empty git repository. 

If you wanted to create a new directory and initialize a git reposity, you can do so with the following commands:

```
mkdir NewDirectory
cd NewDirectory
git init
```

Init will create the repository in the current directory and will encapsulaste all content, including other directories.
